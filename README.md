# Frontend Mentor - Time tracking dashboard



![Design preview for the Time tracking dashboard coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you would like to practice working with JSON data, we provide a local `data.json` file for the activities. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the content in the `.html` file.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

### Expected behaviour

- The text for the previous period's time should change based on the active timeframe. For Daily, it should read "Yesterday" e.g "Yesterday - 2hrs". For Weekly, it should read "Last Week" e.g. "Last Week - 32hrs". For monthly, it should read "Last Month" e.g. "Last Month - 19hrs".

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS DOM & fetch with the json available

### What I learned
This was the by far the challenge in frontend Mentor i have more difficulties so far, and the solution it's not responsive in every scenario i wanted. I will rebuild this challenge with a new html because i think my major problem it's in put the style in the element's. I learned a lot o javascript with this challenge mostly how to manipulate the DOM with data fetch with the json in the files.
